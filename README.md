# Distributed Systems and Cloud Computing [CLOUDS]
This repository contains my project notebooks for the Distributed Systems and Cloud Computing course at EURECOM.

### Course abstract
The goal of this course is to provide a comprehensive view on recent topics and trends in distributed systems and cloud computing. We will discuss the software techniques employed to construct and program reliable, highly-scalable systems. We will also cover architecture design of modern datacenters that constitute a central topic of the cloud computing paradigm. The course is complemented by a number of lab sessions to the design of scalable algorithms and get hands-on experience with Apache Spark.

## Notebooks
### [Introduction](https://github.com/JZ-LIANG/Distributed-Systems-and-Cloud-Computing/blob/master/notebooks/Lab1%20-%20Introduction.ipynb)

In this introductory laboratory:
 * Acquire Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy
 * Gain familiarity with the PySpark and how to interact with the HDFS
 * Gain hands-on experience with two distributed codes: 
   * word count 
   * analysis of night flights


### [Distributed Gradient Descent](https://)

</p>

This notebook contains multiple implementations of the gradient descent algorithm. 
 * generate large set of noisy points for regression and use Scipy lib to obtaine a baseline regression result.
 * a numpy implementation of batch gradient descent.
 * a numpy implementation of stochastic gradient descent and mini-batch stocastic gradient descent.
 * a distributed version of mini-batch gradient descent implemented using PySpark.

Beside i also compare those 4 implementations with the baseline from Scipy. A deep analysis is performed regarding how each algorithm's results change with parameters such as the learning rate and the number of iterations.  Finally an analysis of the performance of all the algorithms in terms of dataset size.


### [k-Means](https:)
<img align="right" src="images/kmeans_img.png" width="300">

As for the previous notebook, this one starts by analyzing the k-means algorithm and its implementation, then it is tested on a generated 2D dataset to have better visualization and it is compared with the sklearn implementation.

An analysis of convergence of datasets of different shapes underlines the important of centroids initialization and introduces the k-means++ technique for smart centroid initialization that is implemented too. Moreover, the elbow method to find the optimal value of the number of clusters is discussed and implemented.

Finally, a distributed version of k-means is implemented with PySpark, the new algorithm is analyzed and compared with the serial implementation.

### [Flights Data Analysis](https:)
<img align="left" src="images/flights_img.png" width="300">

The last notebook introduces the DataFrame API and its advantages with resp√®ct to RDDs, then, DataFrames are built starting from a structured file and from an RDD.

This section is followed by the analysis of flights data using SparkSQL. Data exploration is divided in three main sections: basic queries, flight volume statistics and additional queries. Data visualization is performed using the seaborn module.

The notebook ends with a bonus question regarding the analysis of other datasets and their relation with the used one.
